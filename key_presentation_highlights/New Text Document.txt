In his opening match in 1972 against Polish fighter Ludwik Denderys, Stevenson knocked Denderys down within 30 seconds of the opening bell.

In 1976, Stevenson disposed of his first three opponents in a record 7 minutes and 22 seconds.

Stevenson might have won a fourth gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics, but the Soviet Union boycotted the games, which were hosted by Los Angeles. Cuba followed the Soviet lead, and Stevenson did not compete.

Stevenson retired in 1988 after Cuba decided to skip the Seoul Olympics.
